DataTorch offers a powerful execution environment runner for setting up
pipelines and automating your machine learning lifecycle.

Agents are used to execute custom tasks called pipelines. Pipelines are custom
automated processes that you can set up in your projects to build, test,
package, release, or deploy any code or machine learning model. They are made up
of individual tasks, called actions, and combine together to create jobs.
